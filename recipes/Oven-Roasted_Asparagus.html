    <h3>How to Trim Asparagus</h3>

    <p>
      The quickest and easiest way to trim your asparagus is to line up all the
      (clean) stalks on a cutting board, then use a sharp chef’s knife to cut
      off the thick ends. That’s all there is to it! If you’re worried about
      cutting at the wrong place, here’s a tip from recipe creator

      >: “To remove woody ends, grab a stalk of asparagus at either end and bend
      until it snaps. It will naturally snap where it starts to get tough.”

    <h3>How to Season Asparagus</h3>

    <p>
      This asparagus is simply seasoned with fresh garlic, sea salt, and black
      pepper. Parmesan cheese and fresh lemon juice also lend tons of flavor.
      This is a versatile recipe, so feel free to add spices and customize the
      seasonings to suit your taste.
    </p>

    <h3>How to Cook Asparagus In the Oven</h3>

    <p>
      Roasting asparagus couldn’t be easier: Toss the asparagus with olive oil
      and sprinkle it with cheese and seasonings. Arrange the stalks in a single
      layer in a baking dish, then bake until tender. Sprinkle the roasted
      asparagus with lemon juice before serving, if you like.
    </p>

    <h3>How Long to Bake Asparagus</h3>

    <p>
      In an oven preheated to 425 degrees F, the asparagus should be perfectly
      roasted after about 12 to 15 minutes.
